If you see this warning message, that means you're trying to do any of the following:

1. You're trying to patch already patched DSDT with the main model-specific patch.
2. You're trying to patch your vanilla DSDT, but you haven't selected the main model-specific patch.

Please, run the ProBook Installer again and select correct DSDT options.

If you want to make yourself a new patched DSDT, you should do the following:

Create new USB Clover with Clover.zip and Config.zip in https://www.dropbox.com/sh/28spnh4ozkb424m/AACuCmfpsu9tSvEv_4CSU67za.
Boot from USB
Run PBI Clover Edition again
